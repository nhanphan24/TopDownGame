Top Down Shooting Game:

This game is a project worked on by a team. My role for this project was programming.
I was responsible for creating character movement, shooting machanic, enemy spawning,
and camera movement. The player can move with W for up, D for right, S for down, and A
for left. Additionally, the scrolling wheel on the mouse allows the player to zoom in
and out. Moreover, the left click let users shoot at the enemies. The enemies are
generated throughout the game. They chase the user if the user gets within a certain
distance.
